<h2><a id="C1">Statement of purpose of the site</a></h2>
<p>
Depending up on the financial ability a person may not have a own house or a person may have many houses, but every person need a house to live in. so a person who doesn't have a house has to rent some ones house and a person who has many houses has to let his houses for rent in order to gain some profit from them . So there should be a bridge between these two persons, in past there used to be some people who acts as broker between them and take some money from each of them, but a person cannot handle much data as a computer can handle and his scope would be upto certain part of a town or so. But our website acts as a bridge between those two people who are in need of rented property and who are in need to rent their property with a large scope over the web.
